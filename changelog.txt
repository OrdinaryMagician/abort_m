- Cowboy respects player's desired fov.

Public Beta 1 Hotfix 3 - April 1st 2018 18:23

Public Beta 1 Hotfix 7 - April 1st 2018 23:12

- Disabled FOV visual effect for Cowboy. Turns out SetFOV isn't per-player
  (gonna bug Nash about this one for sure).

  is viewing whoever is emitting these, this fixes jumpy sound in MP due to
  lag.

  an additional measure to avoid accidental presses.

- Fixed Astolfo counters in MP.
- Added quick kick to all weapons (uses reload button).

- The Revenant head permanent screaming bug should be gone now (hopefully).
  If it isn't, then I guess it can be a feature?

  alternative doesn't look as good, but at least doesn't destroy the framerate.

- Revenant heads can now be kicked by pressing use.
- Fixed a lot of badly written bounce behavior.

Public Beta 2 FOOTBALLfix - April 17th 2018 21:49

- I figured making the rev heads also get flung around if you kick them would
  look more fun, so there you go (also works for other weapons, but kick gives
  best results).

Version 0.99 - April 30th 2018 21:18

  when summoned.

- Implemented Random berserk skins, and tweaked how skin handling works.

Version 1.0 Hotfix 3 - May 8th 2018 18:22
