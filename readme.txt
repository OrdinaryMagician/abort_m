abort_m - The weapon mod nobody asked for
---

A sort of spiritual sequel to ouch_m, featuring dumb weapon ideas such as
defeating enemies through the power of headpats, or a button that crashes the
game when pressed.

The raster of items
---

  Ricesphere (replaces berserk and invulnerability)
  ---
  Defeat your enemies with the raging power of RICE. Boosts all weapons.

  Absurdsphere (extremely rare invulnerability replacement) [COMING IN 1.2]
  ---
  Permanently unlocks an additional fire mode (Weapon Mode 1 in settings) for
  many weapons, along with altfires for the heads. These new fire modes are
  rather absurd, even for a mod like this. You're in for a surprise.

  Piece of Candy (replaces health bonus)
  ---
  Collect 'em all! There's many varieties to find, each with different healing
  factors and even some special effects!

  Block of Tofu (replaces armor bonus)
  ---
  The power of tofu gradually strengthens your body. Sometimes a rare, useless
  blue tokoroten might spawn. Feel free to ignore it.

  Banana (replaces stimpack)
  ---
  Bananarama.

  Pickle Jar (replaces medikit)
  ---
  Doomguy should be strong enough to open these with ease.

  Saucesphere (replaces soulsphere)
  ---
  A holy spirit orb made entirely of barbecue sauce. Provides very generous
  healing capabilities, and is rather tasty.

  Comfy pants (replaces green armor)
  ---
  They're very comfy.

  Very comfy pants (replaces blue armor)
  ---
  Even comfier pants. They're actually shorts, so in addition they're also easy
  to wear.

  Shimapansphere (replaces megasphere)
  ---
  May the power of pantsu grant you strength in combat.

  Blurrysphere (replaces blursphere)
  ---
  A sphere that's very blurry. Makes you almost completely invisible.

  Brightsphere (replaces lite-amp)
  ---
  A very bright light source to carry around.

  Warning: May attact unwanted moths.

The rooster of wepons
---

  Hint: All weapons have a "quick kick" feature available by using Reload.

  Hint 2: Most weapons have a "fast throw" feature available by using Zoom.
  The bigger the gun, the harder it hits. Usually, if it already is thrown in
  some way or isn't a physical thing, it won't have this feature.

Slot 1

  Finger poke (replaces fist)
  ---
  You can probably kill something this way.

  Altfire: Headpat your enemies until they become so flustered they burst
  into treats. If the enemy takes any damage during the process, you have to
  start all over again.

  Floor Tile (replaces chainsaw)
  ---
  You know those hexagonal floor tiles that are all over the place? I bet
  they're great as a weapon.

  Altfire: Throw the tile like a shuriken. You have to pick it back up, by the
  way.

Slot 2

  Pea shooter (replaces pistol)
  ---
  It shoots peas.

  Altfire: Eat a couple peas for health.

Slot 3

  Box o' pellets (replaces shotgun)
  ---
  Throw pellets directly at enemies, no need for shotguns when you have the
  very own power of your hands. Extended use may cause grumpiness and ogling of
  women's posteriors.

  Altfire: Rapid fire, higher spread.

  Gunshotgun (replaces super shotgun)
  ---
  The real Mr. BIG SHOT of this mod.

  Altfire: Shreds the guns for more projectiles to be shot, slightly faster.

  Foamgun (replaces shotgun)
  ---
  Covers everything in soft, bubbly, cushy foam and, somehow, kills enemies.

  Altfire: Charged shot, can splat entire rooms.

  Spam Cannon (replaces super shotgun)
  ---
  Spam is what's for dinner. Feed 'em the goods.

  Altfire: Wide spread spam shot. Nothing is safe.

Slot 4

  Big P (replaces chaingun)
  ---
  It shoots peas faster. P is stored in the gun.

  Altfire: Also eats peas for health.

  A Salt Rifle (replaces chaingun)
  ---
  Makes enemies salty. The debuff aplied causes them to become enraged and
  attack anyone, including themselves.

  Altfire: PJSalt. Grenade shot.

Slot 5

  Lewd (replaces rocket launcher)
  ---
  A magic trick fun for the whole family. All enemies in your line of sight
  will spontaneously feel explosive butthurt.

  Altfire: BITE THE PILLOW, I'M GOING IN DRY.

  Thonk Grenades (replaces rocket launcher)
  ---
  Hmmmm...

  Altfire: HMMMMMMMMMMM...

Slot 6

  Haunted astolfo bean plush (replaces plasma rifle)
  ---
  Gives you succ and calls you a gay. Throw it at enemies for best effect.
  Astolfo's succ powers are fueled by bepis. 3 cans should be enough.
  Enemies might accidentally attack the target of succ while trying to pull
  Astolfo off them.

  Altfire: Drink bepis for extra health and armor.

  Ravegun (replaces plasma rifle)
  ---
  Sweet bouncing rainbow lasers. Rave music not included.

  Altfire: Charged shot, stronger but slower.

Slot 7

  The Ouch Face (replaces BFG9000)
  ---
  Everything is pain. Inflict endless screaming on your enemies.

  Tim Allen (replaces BFG9000)
  ---
  It's tool time.

Slot 8

  The big fuckoff abort button
  ---
  A shiny blue button, given to you from the very start. You press it, it
  throws an abort exception. As simple as that.
